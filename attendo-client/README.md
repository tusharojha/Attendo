## Description

This project is a functional attendance system for students. It is a mobile application that allows students to check in and out of classes. The app shows the available list of **Live** and **Past** Classes. To mark their attendance in the current live class, the student needts to scan a QR Code of the class. The QR code is lively shared by the teacher throught screen share. When a student scans the QR code, the attendance of the student is marked and thus the previous QR code is no longer valid. So for each student, the QR code is different. Also if the teacher closes the live QR sharing, even though the QR code is not scanned by others and is attempted to use that after live button is closed, the attendance will not take place

## Problem Statement

Marking and maintaining attendance of the lectures is a tedious task and students are also using bad practices to mark their attendance. So there is a need of fast, organised and time efficient method to record attendance.
